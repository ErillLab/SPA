## tAI analysis
Analysis of the tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI).

The file `spa-env.yml` can be used to create a conda environment file equipped with all the necessary dependencies for the tAI code. 

The code is in the `src/tAI` folder.

The results can be reproduced by running the `tAI_analysis_pipeline.py` script.
